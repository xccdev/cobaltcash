Cobalt Cash Core integration/staging repository
=================================================

Cobalt Cash (XCC) is a sustainable cryptocurrency designed after Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s vision for Bitcoin. It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer transactional currency designed to offer a solution to the problem posed by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies.

Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by high-powered mining hardware. Cobalt Cash utilizes an energy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm, can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment. The Cobalt Protocol offers a simple solution to Bitcoin sustainability issues and provides a faster, more scalable blockchain that is better suited for daily transactional use.

- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, we call it _SwiftTX_.
- Decentralized blockchain voting providing for consensus based advancement of the current Masternode
  technology used to secure the network and provide the above features, each Masternode is secured
  with a collateral of 50,000 XCC.

### Reward Distribution

| **Block Height** | **Masternodes**  | **PoS**         |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1680-1050000     | 50% (50 XCC)     | 50% (50 XCC)    |
| 1050000-2100000  | 50% (25 XCC)     | 50% (25 XCC)    |
| 2100000-3150000  | 50% (12.5 XCC)   | 50% (12.5 XCC)  |
| 3150000-4200000  | 50% (6.25 XCC)   | 50% (6.25 XCC)  |
| 4200000-5250000  | 50% (3.12 XCC)   | 50% (3.12 XCC)  |
| 5250000-6300000  | 50% (1.56 XCC)   | 50% (1.56 XCC)  |
| 6300000-Infinite | 50% (0.78 XCC)   | 50% (0.78 XCC)  |


### Compile 

```bash
$ cd depends
$ sudo make
$ cd ..
$ sudo ./autogen.sh
$ sudo ./configure --prefix=$PWD/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32
```

A prefix will be generated that's suitable for plugging into Bitcoin's
configure. In the above example, a dir named x86_64-w64-mingw32 will be
created. To use it for Bitcoin:

Common `host-platform-triplets` for cross compilation are:

- `i686-w64-mingw32` for Win32
- `x86_64-w64-mingw32` for Win64
- `x86_64-apple-darwin11` for MacOSX
- `arm-linux-gnueabihf` for Linux ARM 32 bit
- `aarch64-linux-gnu` for Linux ARM 64 bit
